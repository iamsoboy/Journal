                                    The Introduction should be concise (double spaced, typed).
                                    Methods:
                                    The methods section of a research paper provides the information by which a study’s validity is judged.
                                    Therefore, it requires a clear and precise description of how an experiment was done, and the rationale
                                    for why specific experimental procedures were chosen.
                                    The methods section structure should: describe the materials used in the study,
                                    explain how the materials were prepared for the study, describe the research protocol,
                                    explain how measurements were made and what calculations were performed,
                                    and state which statistical tests were done to analyze the data.
                                    This section should contain sufficient detail so that all experimental procedures
                                    can be repeated by others in conjunction with cited references. Procedural detail that has
                                    been published previously should be referred to by citation. When a modified procedure is used,
                                    only the author’s modifications of the previously published method need to be given in detail.
                                    Subheadings should be used.
                                </p>

                                    The page length of this section is set by the amount and types of data to be reported.
                                    Continue to be concise, using figures and tables, if appropriate, to present results most effectively.
                                    Disscussion:
                                    Interpret your data in the discussion in appropriate depth. This means that when you
                                    explain a phenomenon you must describe mechanisms that may account for the observation.
                                    If your results differ from your expectations, explain why that may have happened.
                                    If your results agree, then describe the theory that the evidence supported.
                                    It is never appropriate to simply state that the data agreed with expectations,
                                    and let it drop at that.

                                        Decide if each hypothesis is supported, rejected, or if you cannot make a
